Subsampling Scale Image View Sample App
=======================================

This is a fork of the sample app for [Subsampling Scale Image View](https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view/),
rewritten in Kotlin.

I have separated this app from the main repository so it can be used to build a public facing Google Play
app with simple demos, while the main repository version evolves into a demonstration of more complex
setups and serves as a test app.

Kotlin is used as a learning exercise, and I may make incompatible changes or update to unstable or
pre-release versions of Android build tools so I can experiment with new features.
